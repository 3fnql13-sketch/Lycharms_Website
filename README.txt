Lycharms - One-page React + Tailwind starter
-------------------------------------------

How to run locally:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start development server:
   npm start
3. The site will open at http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured (tailwind.config.js). If you run into issues, follow Tailwind's Create React App guide.
- Replace images in public/images/ with your own photos (keep the same filenames or update the img `src` paths).
- The favicon uses /public/images/logo.png
- SHOP_LINK and EMAIL are set in src/LycharmsOnePage.jsx - update as needed.

Deploying:
- Connect your project to GitHub and use Vercel or Netlify for simple deployment.
- After deploying, you can add a custom domain (e.g., www.lycharms.com) via your hosting provider settings.
